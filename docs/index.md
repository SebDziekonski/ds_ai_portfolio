# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Sebastian Dziekonski

## Aspiring Data Scientist | Machine Learning Enthusiast | Problem Solver

I'm an aspiring Data Scientist with a strong foundation in data analysis and machine learning, developed through a 9-month intensive training program. I specialize in transforming data into actionable insights through preprocessing, predictive modeling, and visualization â€” using tools like Python, Pandas, PyCaret, Streamlit, and SQL.

Iâ€™m passionate about continuous learning and excited to contribute to projects that blend technical rigor with creative thinking. Whether it's building machine learning models, creating interactive dashboards, or exploring new data challenges â€” I'm always eager to grow, collaborate, and innovate.

In the near future I plan to also try my skills in projects that use models like:<br>
 - Text-to-Image<br>
 - Image-to-Text<br>
 - Data-to-Category<br>
 - Data-to-Cluster<br>
 - Data-to-Value<br>
 - And many more<br>

This portfolio showcases some of the projects Iâ€™ve built â€” combining data, design, and storytelling. Take a look around, and feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to connect!

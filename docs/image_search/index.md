# Image Finder

The app uses GPT-4o to generate detailed text descriptions of images, then converts those descriptions into high-dimensional vector embeddings. It stores those embeddings in a Qdrant vector database. Users can later search by typing a description, and the app finds the most semantically similar images using vector search.

# ðŸ’¡ Key Features:
## Multi-modal AI: 
- Understands images and translates them to descriptive text using GPT-4o.

## Semantic Search: 
- Finds similar images based on meaning, not keywords.

## Embeddings: 
- Uses OpenAIâ€™s text-embedding-3-large to convert text into searchable vectors.

## Vector Database: 
- Stores and retrieves embeddings efficiently using Qdrant.

## Interactive UI: 
- Streamlit app with image upload and search functionality.

## ðŸ§  AI Techniques Involved:
- Multimodal AI (GPT-4o) â€“ image â†’ text.

- Natural Language Processing (NLP) â€“ for embedding and understanding descriptions.

- Vector Similarity Search â€“ via cosine similarity in Qdrant.
